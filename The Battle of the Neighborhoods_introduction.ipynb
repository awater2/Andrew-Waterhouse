            "source": "New York City is a major hub for immigrants due to its location near the ocean and the plethra of opportunities to grow. New York City's demographics show that it is a large and ethnically diverse metropolis. It is the largest city in the United States with a long history of international immigration. New York City was home to nearly 8.5 million people in 2014, accounting for over 40% of the population of New York State and a slightly lower percentage of the New York metropolitan area, home to approximately 23.6 million. Over the last decade the city has been growing faster than the region. The New York region continues to be by far the leading metropolitan gateway for legal immigrants admitted into the United States.\n\nThroughout its history, New York City has been a major point of entry for immigrants; the term \"melting pot\" was coined to describe densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. English remains the most widely spoken language, although there are areas in the outer boroughs in which up to 25% of people speak English as an alternate language, and/or have limited or no English language fluency. English is least spoken in neighborhoods such as Flushing, Sunset Park, and Corona.\n\nWith it's diverse culture, comes diverse food items. There are many resturants in New york City, each beloning to different categories like Mediterranean, Indian, Chinese, French, etc.\n\nFor this project, we will focus on Indian food. We want to know all of the great Indian restaurants in New York City, and where they are located. We want to use the Foursquare API data to complete this task. We will list and visualize all major parts of New York City that have great indian resturants.",
